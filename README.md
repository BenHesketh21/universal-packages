# Universal Packages

**Universal Packages** is a CLI tool for pushing and pulling private code packages using [OCI (Open Container Initiative)](https://opencontainers.org/) registries. It provides a ecosystem-agnostic, decentralized, and standardized way to distribute private SDKs and packages across teams and ecosystems.

> ðŸ”§ Currently supports **npm** packages. Future support for pip, NuGet, and Go is planned.

---

## âœ¨ Goals

- âœ… Support for installing and publishing private packages across ecosystems.
- âœ… Use standard OCI registries (e.g. GitHub, AWS, Azure).
- âœ… Minimal ecosystem-specific logic; rely on established package formats.
- âœ… Reproducible and interoperable workflows.
